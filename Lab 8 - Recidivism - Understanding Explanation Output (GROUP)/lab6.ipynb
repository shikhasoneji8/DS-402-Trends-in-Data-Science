Nevertheless, early explaining systems focused on making the what visible to the user, but not the why. Both modes of explanation are useful, but our view is that most current systems focus on justification; justifying why a specific action was taken. Yet we have advocated earlier that an important goal of explanation is to help a user develop a robust and predictive mental model of a system. Justifications may be inefficient ways of doing this, because they are local and focus on specific cases. Global explanations regarding how the system works may be needed as well, and this may serve more directly to help a user understand the workings of a system than individual justifications for particular decisions.\n",
